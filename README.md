# Preface
The [Mosquitto MQTT broker](https://mosquitto.org) provides a number of statistics on the special `$SYS/#` topic (see [mosquitto(8)](https://mosquitto.org/man/mosquitto-8.html)).

# Build requirements
As a Rust programm, a working stable Rust toolchain with Rust *version 1.50 or newer* is required.

Additionally, `cmake`, `pkg-config` and the `libssl` development package are required by the `paho-mqtt` crate.

# Configuration
## Command line parameters
The exporter supports the following command line parameters:

| *Option* | *Description* | *Note* |
|:------------|:--------|:-------|
| `-V` / `--version` | Show version information | |
| `-c <config>` / `--config=<config>`| Path to the configuration file | **mandatory** |
| `-h` / `--help` | Show help text | |
| `-q` / `--quiet` | Log only warning and error messages | |

## Configuration file
The configuration file is a YAML file defining the exporter and MQTT connection parameters:

```yaml
---
service:
  # Address to listen on, default: localhost:9883
  listen: 'localhost:9883'
  # URL path for metrics exposure, default: /metrics
  metrics_path: '/metrics'
mqtt:
  # MQTT authentication
  auth:
    # MQTT user with read permissions on the $SYS/# topic
    user: 'mqtt_user'
    # Password of the MQTT user
    password: 'mqtt_password'
  # MQTT broker address, scheme://address valid schemes are tcp and ssl
  broker: 'tls://mqtt.name.or.addr.ess'
  # CA file to use for server certificate validation, default: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
  ca_file: '/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt'
  # Client side certificate and key, when needed, both must be defined
  client_cert_file: ''
  client_key_file: ''
  # Disable name verification of servers SSL certificate
  insecure_ssl: false
  # maximal time in seconds for reconnect in seconds
  retry_interval: 60
  # timeout for connection establishment in seconds
  timeout: 5
  # QoS, default: 0
  qos: 0
  # Client ID for MQTT connection, default: mosquitto-exporter
  client_id: 'mqtt_client_id'
```
# Using as a system service

This project is configured to be used as systemd/init.d daemon after running make install.

To run as a service first execute `make strip` then `[sudo]* make install`. Note that the instalation
folder can be configured by the DESTDIR variable. By using this variable the software will
be installed in the destination folder, and the configuration of the systemd files is up to you.
If you let the variable empty, the software will be installed in the default folders: /etc/prometheus, /usr/sbin, /lib/systemd/system.

To run the service you will need to provide a valid config.yaml according the example in
the `$(DESTDIR)/etc/prometheus-mosquitto-exporter`. You should edit the file and save/move as config.yaml 
in the same folder or use a custom folder according the OPTIONS variable on the file `$(DESTDIR)/etc/prometheus-mosquitto-exporter/service-env`.

After configuring /etc/prometheus-mosquitto-exporter/config.yaml and/or /etc/prometheus-mosquitto-exporter/service-env (usually not needed)
you can control the service with `sudo service prometheus-mosquitto-exporter [start|restart|stop|status]+`.
